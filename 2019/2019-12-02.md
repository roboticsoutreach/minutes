# Meeting 2019-12-02

A visit to SUSU was performed to check the feasibility of the various areas:
- Old sports hall
  - Possible, but previous issues remain
  - Bar 2 + Cube + Clubs & Socs + Meeting Room 5
    - Doable. This was the preferred option.

We discussed the roles during the summer school, how much value they bring and what roles we would like for next year.
