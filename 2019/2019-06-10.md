# Agenda
1. Test of full kit stack with j5
- WORKS :tada:
- There is an issue with usbmount at the moment that needs sorting for code to autorun from the usb flash drive
2. LiPo storage
- Some LiPos have been storage charged, there are more to do
3. T-Shirt designs
- Are in progress
4. Ultrasound boards
- Some redesigns discussed with regard to layout
5. Market stall construction
- Proposed final designs [here](https://github.com/sourcebots/tasks/issues/75)
- Have been organised into 600 * 300 mm sheets for cutting
- ready to cut once we have finalised the rules document and are ready to commit to the final design
- intention is to add markers to 'upper front' panels so robots can check alignment with vision
6. Arduino firmware
- being updated for this year's game
- removing the ability to query ultrasound distance directly so teams have to calculate it as part of a lab
- removing redundant servo board stuff
