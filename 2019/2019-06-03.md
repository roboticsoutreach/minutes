# Agenda
1. Sponsorships
    - JWi has drafted an email to go to sponsors
2. Toolkits
    - We have taken delivery of some tools and toolkits for SP2019
    - Awaiting remaining to be delivered
3. SP Game
    - Presentation and discussion of game proposals
        - "4-4-2"
        - "Andy's Untitiled Idea"
        - "Apple tree"
        - "High risk high reward"
        - "Tick tock"
    - Decision
        - Based on ["Apple Tree"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Iv3tupVu0DaCbwnhn0LF3hBSwTYSz3jr)
        - The following points for further consideration:
            - number of each type of apple should get more thought
            - maybe replace market stall with bucket
            - DEFINATELY NEED TO TEST CAPACITIVE SENSING BEFORE COMMITTING
            - need to check tree construction
                - check with Will Barber
                - we believe we have access to [this](https://eclipsestagingservices.ae/service-catalogue/staging-services/rigging/truss-accessories/truss-x-base-black/c-23/c-139/p-575) truss stand which would be very helpful
            - Consider "crane" theme instead
            - review points for each apple type
            - check polling sensor is fast enough
            - Starting location move to other corners so movement is trickier?
