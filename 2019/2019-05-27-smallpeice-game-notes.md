        - Prevents issues with robots crashing

- Scrabble
    - Lettered cubes, with random points.
    - Only score points if it makes a word.

- Alistair's pitch
    - 2 robots rectangle arena
    - Home area is 1m from wall
    - 4 sets of tokens:
        - Good = 1 
        - Bad = -2
        - Really Good = 10
        - Really Bad = -20
    - Really X tokens are in raised platforms / cages in center (to stop sweeper arms)

- Gold rush (mIneCRafT)
    - Plain Tokens = 1ish
    - Gold Tokens (Conductive tape?) = 5ish
    - Diamond Token in the middle = 10ish
    - Home zone diagonally opposite to the start zone
    - Distinguish using vision / conductive tape


- Apple tree
    - 'apple' tokens on floor and at a height.
        - attach with velcro / magnets.
    - 'golden apples' on tree score more.


- Clock
    - radial scoring zones, raised inner zones.


- Hopefully points will be proportional to skill.

### Generic ideas:
- Negative point scoring
- Gradation of scoring zones (raised platform = more points?).
- Metallic tape to distinguish cubes.
- Magnets to distinguish cubes (reed switches)
- Placing things in buckets
- Stacking cubes (of different size?)
    - Big cube on small cube = more points?
- Unique cubes, different combinations
    - Scrabble?
    - Half points if two different types are there.
- Putting cubes in neighboring areas to score neighboring area points.
- Cubes stored in robots at end score extra points.
- Velcro attached cubes.
- Token dangling on 'tree'.
- Resistor values between cubes.
- Suction cubes.
- RFID tags.
- Cubres in hard to reach places.
- Thick ply carpet tile.
- Line following
    - Shiny tape?
    - Cubes on path, easy pickup.
    - Black carpet, white tape.
        - (Test in labs with a corner of arena.)
- Different return path.

## Dissuaded ideas
- Randomly positioning different cubes

## "Groups" of robots

- Dead reckoning - Score some points
- Ultrasonic distance sensors
- Basic CV (i.e just recognising a marker type)
- Decent CV (i.e using it to navigate)

## Scheduling

Alistair requests 2 teams per game to save him Z3 efforts.

16 teams of 5.

8 matches per round

2 minute match

## Why make a game

- See the email alistair sent (link please)
    - This will be aded to the SRO Knowledgebase(Alistair permitting). Link coming soon.

Needs to have mechanical, programming and game strategy learning opportunities. Using sensors for bonuses
