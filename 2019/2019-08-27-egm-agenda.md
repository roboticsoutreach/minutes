# EGM Agenda - Murray Building 58/1035 - Tuesday 27th August 7pm

This EGM is being called to make changes to the current constitution. A further EGM will be called to fill committee positions shortly.

The Summer School Lead should also be available and on hand for the entire week of the summer school as the volunteer coordinator. If this isn't possible a second summer school lead should be assigned.
