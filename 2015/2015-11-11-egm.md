# Election of initial official committee

Anonymous ballot requested.

Pen and paper ballot decided.

A short speech was given by both candidates for Equipment and Safety Officer.

Votes were written on paper and deposited at the front. Votes for president and
the rest of the committee were split so that Murray could count the votes for
president and Tom (the chair) the votes for everyone else.

All uncontested committee positions were unanimously elected (8 for the person
running and 0 for RON)

Equipment and Safety Officer:

Samson Danziger 5
Kier Davis 3.

The new committee is therefore:

President: Tom Leese

Secretary: Murray Colpman

Treasurer: Rashmi Jey

Social Secretary: Andrew Barrett-Sprot

Equipment and Safety Officer: Samson Danziger

# Review of rest of constitution
