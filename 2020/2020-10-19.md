# SRO Meeting with Reena Pau and Son Hoang                                           

* We could do a sourcebots-like event. Completely online and we can use python.
*	Virtual breakout rooms, could be hosted on teams.
*	Can be done better this time.
*	Matches can be spaced out every weekend. Like SR.
*	Students in each group will not know each other.
* Collaborative code environment (like google docs). We would need to consider a version control system. 
  * Github code space
  *	Vs code live share
  *	Repl.it (https://repl.it/)
*	Concerns about people who do not know how to program
  *	They should get a head start
  *	Everyone will need to contribute to the project, otherwise the strong programmers will do everything
*	We will use timetabled sessions 
*	The game could be something that would not be possible in the real world (i.e something that isn’t a robot simulator).
  *	The issue about making a robot simulator game is that you will need to model an arena
*	We might want to consider allowing students to customize robots.
  *	They could customize the appearance of the robot
  *	They could customize the arrangement of the sensors on the robot (although this would be difficult).
*	We could simulate the electronics of the robot. 
*	https://robotbenchmark.net/
*	We could run simulations without rendering it (for a dry test run, hasn’t been tested yet)
*	Talk to Jake Howard, Peter Law, Oliver Wales. 
*	We can bump up the number of students participating from 30 to 50 or beyond.
*	We could use remote compute servers.
*	Emphasis on doing meetings for freshers.
*	sro@soton.ac.uk needs to be fixed. 
*	Power Boards: Waiting on approval for finance. Some components at Farnell are out of stock. The components need to be replaced.
*	We can work to get the kit finished and prepare for Robocon 2022 this academic year.
*	Son has received some kit as part of the orders before the lockdown.
*	We need to audit the kit database.
