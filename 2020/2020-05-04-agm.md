## Yearly Report
We had the most successful smallpeice ever last year, many thanks to Dan Trickey, but also to the whole team.

Smallpeice 2020 probably won't happen due to coronavirus, but we're hoping Smallpeice 2021 will be a great success.

## Finance
We raised Â£500 pounds from a new sponsorship deal with CMR!

## AGM Method
Due to coronavirus we carried out the AGM via microsoft forms. Daniel Hobson and Jenny Walker audited the results
