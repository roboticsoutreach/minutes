# 14th April Tech Day (Retro)

## What went well
- Lots of teams were present
- We held a towing tank tour
- We had spare films 
- We set up a test arena and people used it!
- We now have a stream overlay. (Thanks Tyler)
- We made pedastals!
- The lift buttons were labelled
    - But not both of then

## What could have been better
- Weird IO Error (Connection refused) so we had to swap out their servo board with one of our own.
- Door access 
    - Non-carded people couldn't access
- Test arena wasn't big enough for a team.
- No communication between teams in Level 4 and Level 2 labs.

## How can we improve
- We didn't hold a high voltage lab or cleanroom tour.
    - Action point: Make a check list for things we need for a tech day
- Label both of the panels in the lift.
- We should have more clear signage as some people got lost.
