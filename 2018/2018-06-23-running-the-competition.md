# How to run the competition
1. Team coordination
    - Teams have been informed something will happen
    - There's a sign up on the page
    - Questionnaire on laptop use?
        - Not sure if we can get the data.
        - Lots of assumptions based on teams 10 years ago, we need to re-evaluate to see if we can chop things out.
2. Kit prep
    - Use dev kits to set up a testing pipeline
    - Get some hardware for testing (i.e. Battery current )
    - Odroids? Pi switch?
3. Event coordination
    - Kickstart
        - If in uni, we can do later,
        - If not in uni we should start it now
        - Dates as early as possible.
    - Competition
        - Newbury Cost
        - Dates
4. Mentoring
6. Supporting stuff
    - No user accounts
    - IDE? 
    - Forums?
    - Evaluate throwing away software.
    - Do teachers have opinions for other things we can do to support them?
7. Fundraising for the future
    - We want to invite people to the competition
8. Organisational improvements
   - (i.e. removing old)
