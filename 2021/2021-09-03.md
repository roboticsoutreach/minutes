## Bank account

Jenny, Anton, Stefan and Tommy met to change bank account signatories. Forms to complete the process will be sent to the society's postbox in the Zepler building. We still need to finish the transfer process ASAP, then get debit cards so we can buy the bunfight supplies.

Stefan and Tommy will be the new signatories once the forms are filled in and sent back.

## Bunfight

Jenny and Anton left the meeting and Tommy and Stefan planned the Bunfight table.

Summary to send to SUSU:

- New roller banner
- Motorised SRO flag people can hoist and lower
- Leaflets
- Our new RUB-bot
- Line-following robot and a line on the table
- Laptop/tablet with mailing list sign-up form
