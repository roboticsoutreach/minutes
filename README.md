Repository for the society minutes

All files should be in [Markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

All files should be stored under `YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD-optional-description.md`.

The optional description is only necessary if it is not an ordinary meeting, for example in an AGM. It should only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters, separated with `-` for different words.

The CI will reject any pull requests that contain files not of this type.

All pull requests should use a rebase merge, this is enforced at the repo level.

If you are failing the tests, you can view the logs on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/roboticsoutreach/minutes), and clicking on the relevant commit.
