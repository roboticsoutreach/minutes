Repository for the society minutes

All files should be in [Markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

All files should be stored under `YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD_Optional_Description.md`.

The optional description is only necessary if it is not an ordinary meeting, for example in an AGM.

The CI will reject any pull requests not of this type.

All pull requests should use a rebase merge, this is enforced at the repo level.
